# Requirements

Repository for collecting requirements for scikit-allel.

The [stories](stories) directory contains examples of analysis protocols that we would like to be able to run using scikit-allel, together with generic pydata/scipy tools.

The [data](data) directory contains information about public datasets available for use as example inputs.
