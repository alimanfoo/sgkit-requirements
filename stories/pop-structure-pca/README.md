# Principal components analysis to identify population structure

## Introduction

I'm a population geneticist studying a non-human diploid species. 
I have performed deep whole-genome sequencing on a set of individuals collected from nature.
I have produced a set of genome-wide analysis-ready SNP calls for those individuals.
I would like to perform a principal components analysis to explore evidence for genetic population structure.
E.g., I'd like to know how many genetically distinct populations are represented by the individuals I've sampled, and whether or not genetic structure is associated with any other variables such as location or date of sampling.
